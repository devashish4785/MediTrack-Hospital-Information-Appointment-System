# 🏥 MediTrack: Cloud-Based Health Data Platform (AWS)

**MediTrack** is a modular, cloud-native hospital information system designed to manage patient records, doctor schedules, and appointments using RESTful APIs. Built entirely on AWS, it supports secure, scalable, and real-time health data processing, analytics, and role-based access control.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🌐 **REST APIs** to manage patient records, appointments, and schedules via **AWS Lambda + API Gateway**
- 🧠 **Real-time log ingestion** from multiple hospital branches using **Amazon Kinesis**
- 🧹 **ETL and data transformation** pipelines via **AWS Glue**
- 🛢️ **Centralized data warehousing** in **Amazon Redshift** for unified analytics
- 📊 **Interactive dashboards** for hospital executives with **Amazon QuickSight**
- 🔐 **Secure access control** using **AWS Cognito** (patient, doctor, admin roles)
- 💾 **Transaction support** using **Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL)** for OLTP workloads
- ☁️ **Fully serverless, cloud-native, and modular architecture**

## ⚙️ Setup & Deployment

> ⚠️ This project is intended for AWS learners and may incur cloud charges. Use free tier services and clean up after testing.

### Prerequisites
- AWS Account (with IAM access)
- Python 3.8+
- AWS CLI & Boto3 configured
- PostgreSQL client (for RDS)
- Terraform / CDK (optional for infrastructure)

### Steps

1. **Deploy API Layer**
   - Create Lambda functions for:
     - `create_patient.py`
     - `get_patient.py`
     - `schedule_appointment.py`
   - Connect to **API Gateway** using HTTP triggers.

2. **Setup Amazon RDS**
   - Use PostgreSQL for OLTP storage of patient data.
   - Define schema for patients, appointments, and doctors.

3. **Implement Real-Time Logging**
   - Stream application logs to **Amazon Kinesis Firehose**.

4. **ETL Pipeline with Glue**
   - Create a Glue job that:
     - Cleans incoming logs
     - Transforms and loads into **Amazon Redshift**

5. **Build Analytics Dashboard**
   - Use **QuickSight** to connect with Redshift
   - Build KPIs: Avg. wait time, daily appointments, per-branch traffic

6. **Enable Cognito Authentication**
   - Create Cognito User Pools & IAM roles.
   - Apply role-based access to Lambda functions.
